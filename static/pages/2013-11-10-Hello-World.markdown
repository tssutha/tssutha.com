### Hello, world!
---

Hi, I just started an *actual* blog, want to write about programming,software, microelectronics packaging,
soccer and of course about my travelling. Stay tuned for *actual* content!

This web site is developed using Python, Web.Py, MarkDown, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The site template was
inspired based on [Mihneadb.Net](https://github.com/mihneadb/mihneadb.github.io) and deployed it on [Heroku Cloud Application Platform](https://www.heroku.com/)

For last 5 years I am working as Software Developer for microelectronics packaging industry, mainly developing
desktop based application using C/C++, MFC, C#, WPF, SQL, STL, XML and UML. This website is an attempt to learn web technologies 
and learning hard to make a quick transition into web, mobile and cloud world.

Thanks for your feedback.
