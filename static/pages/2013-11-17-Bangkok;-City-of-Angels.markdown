### Bangkok : City of Angels
---
We are fortunate enough to live and work in Singapore and decided to visit Southeast Asia
As much as possible during our stay in Singapore. As part of the plan, last month I and my
Wife visited Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand for short stay, our main intention was
to explore Bangkok city as much as possible during those short 5 days.

Here are some facts about Bangkok City
<ul>
<li>  Bangkok city is quite big compared to other famous cities in Southeast Asia.</li>
<li<  The city is set up around the Chao Phraya River delta in Central Thailand, it is 
	similar setup like western countries.</li>
<li>  The culture is somehow related to Hinduism,  we can evidence many things which we 
	studied in Hindu Religion subject at Schools in Sri Lanka.</li>
<li>People are nice, but the language barrier is there as not everyone can speak or 
	understand English.</li>
<li>Travel by Taxi and Tuk Tuk (3 Wheeler) is very cheap compared to other countries,
	but travel by route buses is similar experience like in Sri Lanka or India.
	Buses are too dirty and crowded.</li>
<li>Even though Thailand is a buddhist country, it's very confusing to see Buddha, Rama,
	Ravana and Lord Vishnu together in temples.</li>
<li> Last but not least entertainment and foods are very cheap, especially those international
    buffets at river cruise and star hotels. 
</ul>
