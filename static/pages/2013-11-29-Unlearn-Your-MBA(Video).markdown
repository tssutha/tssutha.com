### Unlearn Your MBA (Video) - By David Heineimeier Hansson

Yesterday, I came across a talk "Unlearn Your MBA" by [Ruby on Rails][link6]
creator [David Heineimeier Hansson][link7]. He is also a partner of a successful
self funded company [37 Signals][link1]. I am a big fan and follower of their 
blog [Signal Vs Noise][link2] and Their awesome books [Getting Real][link3], [Rework][link4]
and [Remote][link5]. 

Everyone who wants to build their own product or run their own company, must
watch this talk. He is a real example for how to bootstrap a successful
company from open source softwares and returns something back to the 
community. 

In his talk, he explains the problems with MBA approach to run a small business
and how it is considered in big cooperate world. 

My favorite quote from his talk. 
>The weakness in our value chain with the customer was</br>
>really in our core product.</br>

 David translates this message to human language. 
>Let's be honest, our pizza used to suck. I am sorry.</br>
>I swear the new ones will be better.</br>
